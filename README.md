## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Learning about the advantages of Sass over CSS. Writing custom class functions with @mixins and creating class variables.

### Continued development

This was a good exercise to reinforce the basics. I am looking to learn more about writing reusable classes.

### Useful resources

- [Saas Docs](https://sass-lang.com/implementation/) - This helped me refresh my memory on implementing Sass. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
